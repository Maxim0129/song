[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty?
But I hit right back
'Cause you got that-that, yeah
Why you always wanna act like lovers
But you never wanna be each others'?
I say, "Don't look back"
But I go right back and

[Pre-Chorus]
All the sudden, I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away
